  - Surprise! I'm not dead yet.
  - '...'
  - I don't remember your mum very well, but I remember those eyes.
  - How many years has it been since our parents banished her?
  - She met your father and got pregnant before marriage...
  - which was unacceptable in our family.
  - '...'
  - I was a child when that happened, and I didn't know how to contact her later.
  - This all was my last attempt to correct the past and unite our family.
  - '...'
  - I'm glad you came.
  - Would you like a cup of tea? I believe you have a lot of questions.
